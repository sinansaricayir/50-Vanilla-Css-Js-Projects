50 Projects Just With Css3 And Vanilla Javascript


Hello, I'm Sinan. I am working as a backend developer in a software company and I am developing software with the Laravel framework. 

Because of my interest in front-end, I will be sharing here both to learn and to keep what I learned at hand. By the way, I will not use any framework. 

I will be using vanilla css and javascript in all my projects.
